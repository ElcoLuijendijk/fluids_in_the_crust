### Lectures

This module introduces fluid flow in the crust and the interaction of fluids with geological processes such as heat flow and deformation. The lecture part of the course (LV1) first introduces the basic physics of crustal fluid flow, heat flow and deformation (lectures 1-6). We will subsequently study fluid flow systems at a range of scales and settings, including the potential of fluid flow through the lower crust, regional flow in sedimentary basins and orogens and localized hydrothermal systems in faults. The course includes a critical review of case studies from the recent scientific literature.
