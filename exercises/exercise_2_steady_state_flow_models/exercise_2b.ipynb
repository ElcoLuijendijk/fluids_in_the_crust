Heat conduction and groundwater flow are governed by very similar diffusion laws. We will adjust the parameters and boundary conditions of your groundwater model to instead calculate steady-state geothermal gradients in the lithosphere. "

For the depth of the upper crust we can use a value of 12 km and for the depth of the lower crust 35 km. Try to place the new lines of code where you define heat production *after* the line where you calculate the first steady-state geothermal gradient (ie., after first call of the ``solve_steady_state_diffusion_eq function``).

However, the solution we derived for steady-state groundwater flow and heat flow equations assumes that *K* is constant, since we moved *K* out of the derivative.
